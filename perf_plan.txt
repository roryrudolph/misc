- What types of devices are to be connected per port?
- What protocols do these devices communicate over, including wireless?
- If a protocol can handle multiple devices, how many are to be used?
- How fast do these devices transmit data?
- What is the size of the data payload, excluding protocol overhead?
- Do all devices transmit the same size and rate of data? If not, how so?

- What message busses are to be used?
- What software should be used to move the data from port to message bus?

- What operations are to be performed on the data?
- What software should be used to perform these operations?
- How long are the operations to last?
- In what order are the operations performed?
- Where does the data go when through with operations?
- What messages are to be sent back to devices?

- What Dell software should be running on the gateway?
